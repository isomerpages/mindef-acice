The ACICE is led by a Singaporean Executive Director, who oversees the day-to-day operations of the ACICE.

The ACICE has an Advisory Board comprising the ADSOM Working Group (WG) Leaders or delegated representatives from all ASEAN Member States’ defence establishments. The Chairman of the Advisory Board will be held by the sitting ADMM Chair.

The ACICE comprises three centres – the Cybersecurity Centre, the Information Centre and the Research Centre. The Cybersecurity and Information Centres will host defence experts from the cybersecurity and information domains respectively, and will produce regular reports, as well as facilitate information sharing in that domain. The Research Centre will collaborate with think-tanks and academic institutes to conduct longer-term research on the impact of developments in digital and information technologies on defence.  

The progress of ACICE will be reported annually to the ADMM through the ADSOM and ADSOM WG.
