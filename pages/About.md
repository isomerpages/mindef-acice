The ADMM Cybersecurity and Information Centre of Excellence (ACICE) was conceptualised as a result of the unique threats posited by cybersecurity, disinformation and misinformation to defence establishments. Such threats could impact critical infrastructure or networks, or have the potential to fracture social cohesion within and across states, while giving hostile actors opportunities to influence public opinion and undermine trust in governments. 

Hence, the ACICE was set up to focus on confidence-building measures, enhancing information-sharing, and capacity building among ASEAN defence establishments. The ACICE aims to enhance multilateral cooperation among ASEAN defence establishments against cyberattacks, disinformation and misinformation, for the regionâ€™s collective peace and security.
