<p>The ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting (ADMM) Cybersecurity and Information
Centre of Excellence (ACICE) and S. Rajaratnam School of International
Studies (RSIS) co-hosted the 2nd Digital Defence Symposium (DDS) from 24
to 25 July 2024 at The Fullerton Hotel Singapore. The DDS brought together
more than 200 senior defence officials, academics, industry experts and
international partners from across 22 countries within and outside ASEAN,
to discuss the latest developments in the cybersecurity and information
domains, amid challenges presented by emerging technologies and rising
geopolitical tensions.</p>
<p>Executive Deputy Chairman of RSIS Ambassador Ong Keng Yong welcomed the
participants to the DDS and noted that unlike traditional defence concerns,
cyber and information threats are not limited to national borders. He highlighted,
“It is more important than before for ASEAN countries to adopt a coordinated
approach in dealing with the challenges of modern warfare and digitalisation,
as we work together towards a safer and more secure region.”</p>

<p>Several events were organised on the sidelines of the symposium, including
the 3rd ACICE Experts Panel meeting. Chaired by Permanent Secretary for
Defence Development Mr Melvyn Ong, the Experts Panel comprises renowned
academics and industry experts who advise ACICE on emerging global trends
and developments in the cybersecurity and information domains. The 2nd
ASEAN Roundtable on Navigating the Digital Space and the 3rd ACICE Advisory
Board meeting took place on 24 and 25 July 2024 respectively.</p>
<p>ACICE was established by the 15th ADMM in June 2021. ACICE aims to connect
ASEAN countries and other international partners to enhance multilateral
cooperation in the defence sectoral against cyberattacks, disinformation
and misinformation through information sharing and capacity building. To
date, ACICE has published more than 100 reports to raise awareness of and
knowledge on potential threats, trends and developments in the cybersecurity
and information domains. Most recently, ACICE organised a Cyber Incident
Response and Threat Analysis course for ASEAN military cyber practitioners
to gain a deeper understanding of cybersecurity and exchange perspectives
on cyber challenges and threats across Southeast Asia.</p>
